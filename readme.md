# SmartSystems.cc &nbsp;–&nbsp; Site Build README  
*AI-powered workflow design for small-to-mid manufacturing, service, and logistics firms*

---

## 1. Purpose & Audience  
**Smart Systems** is a boutique advisory that parachutes into SMBs and turns their spreadsheets & email chaos into low-code, AI-driven workflows.  
The site must convince **operations-minded owners** (HVAC shops, industrial distributors, 3PLs, etc.) that we:  

1. Understand their pain (missed jobs, slow quotes, dispatch chaos).  
2. Can stand up practical automations fast.  
3. Bring deep ops cred – not generic “AI gurus.”

## 3. Copy Guidelines  

### Voice  
*Futuristic pragmatism*: confident, concise, lightly technical. Avoid buzzword soup.  

### About Us (sample draft – paraphrase freely)  
> I’m **Saad Farhad** – engineer, Cambridge MBA, and ops troubleshooter. For a decade I’ve transformed factories and field teams: shaving weeks off lead-times, merging post-acquisition plants, and automating everything from MRP to maintenance. Now I weaponize GPT-4, low-code, and IoT sensors so a 20-person shop operates like a Tier-1 OEM.  

Include quick stats:  
* “10+ yrs in manufacturing & operations”  
* “Led 7 multimillion-dollar lean deployments”  
* “Former GE nuclear-valve design lead & Kearney consultant”  

### Offerings (card blurbs)  

| **System** | Pain Points | Data Inputs | Automation Engine | Output Value |
|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Smart Scheduling** | Missed/duplicated bookings | Email / web-form requests; Google Cal | GPT-powered slot match + Calendly API | Confirmations + SMS reminders in <30 s |
| **Instant Quoting** | Slow/erroneous RFQs | Excel price sheet; request email | GPT parser + Zapier doc-merge | Branded PDF quote in minutes |
| **Auto Dispatch** | Wrong tech, idle trucks | Work-orders sheet; skills matrix | n8n rules + map distance calc | Tech texted & job board updated |
| **Bespoke AI** | Any repetitive admin drain | Your messy data | Rapid prototype → iterate | Custom workflow in 2-4 weeks |

## 4. Design Language  

| Element | Spec |
|---------|------|
| **Palette** | Navy #0d1b2a (bg), Slate #1b263b (cards), Off-white #e0e1dd (text), Neon #41c9e2 (CTAs) |
| **Fonts**  | `Space Grotesk` (headings), `Inter` (body) |
| **Layout** | Full-screen hero → vertical snap sections; Flex/Grid; generous whitespace |
| **Visual Cues** | Subtle glassmorphism cards; SVG line icons; micro-interactions (hover glow on CTAs) |
| **Feel** | “Industrial-futuristic”: crisp lines, hint of neon, dark-mode default |

## 5. Tech Stack  

* **HTML5 / CSS Grid / Flexbox** – single-page smooth scroll  
* **GSAP or AOS** – fade/slide reveals  
* **Form handling** – `mailto:serchappbugs@yahoo.com` for MVP; swap to Formspree/Netlify Forms in prod  
* **Optional** – Integrate Calendly inline embed for live call booking  

Folder scaffold:
/
│ index.html
│ README.md          ← this file
├─ /css  (style.css)
├─ /js   (main.js)   // scroll, menu, form validation
└─ /assets

## 6. Build Steps for Cursor  

1. **Clone scaffold** above.  
2. Craft hero section with background image + overlay gradient.  
3. Implement nav with smooth-scroll anchors (`scroll-margin-top` for section IDs).  
4. Recreate Offerings cards grid; animate on viewport.  
5. Insert About Us copy & metrics layout.  
6. Build Contact form → `mailto:`. Add fallback note: “Prefer a call? Click to book Calendly.”  
7. Optimize for <90 Lighthouse perf & a11y.  
8. Deploy to Vercel; map `smartsystems.cc` DNS.

**Deliverable:** a polished, futuristic single-page site that turns ops headaches into booked calls.
